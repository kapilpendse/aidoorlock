# Issues

- If you already have role SNSSuccessFeedback stack creation will fail.  This is the default role name when setting up SMS delivery logging, so many people would likey have this already.  Iâ€™d recommend something else (like AIDoorLock_SMSRole demo or something), or allowing this to be a user defined value/create if needed.
- In the demo runbook, make enrolled_guest.jpg in red text so it more explicitly is called out.  (I missed this step).


# Ideas

1. SMS should be sent to the host and the expected guest every time the door is successfully.
